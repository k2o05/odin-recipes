        <h2>Karak Chai and its History!</h2>
        <p><strong>Karak chai</strong> is a style of masala chai that translates from Hindi to “strong tea.” It’s rich and creamy thanks to evaporated milk and is usually made with fewer spices than masala chai. Recipes vary family to family and some may include saffron.</p>
        <p>I think this recipe is a happy medium. It has just enough spices to be comforting, warming and delicious without being overpowering. Karak tea is simple to make, but such a delicious tea to drink!</p>
